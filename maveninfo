maven is an automation tool which we can integrate with jenkins to execute the tests in one go
if you want to run the the test cases in maven through cmd then the class name should end with "test" keyword
to create testng.xml file we can select project and by doing right click on it we can go to testng then we can select convert to testng
by using testng xml suite maven dependency we can run a particular tetng xml file through maven from cmd( just refer pom.xml for the code)
we have to put this dependency under sure fire plugin 
mvn -Dtest=TestCircle test (this command helps us to run an individual class among multiple classes present in maven project

we can switch between the tests by making different profiles like in this project in pom.xml i made two different profiles for smoke and regression tests
to run these profiles from cmd we need to use "mvn test -PSmoke "  this is the command . after P we can ention our profile name
under the profile tag we need to make profiles and we need to copy the code from <build> tag
testng is regression and testng2 is smoke profile
