generally in real time companies host jenkins on servers but here we cannt do this
jenkins is for conitnuation integration tools by which we can push code, trigger test cases and many more activities
we will use .war file for the system because we are using jenkins as a window service and not hosting it to any web server
java -jar jenkins.war -httpPort=8080
in jenkin we can configure maven framework completely
for maven and java dependency we can set path from GLOBAL TOOL CONFIGURATION which can be assesed from MANAGE GENKINS 
under CONFIGURE option which present under the project we made in jenkins we can set path and give goal(testrun command) to execute the results.
